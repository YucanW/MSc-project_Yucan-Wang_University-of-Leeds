you want PURE, 100% PALM SUGAR (and there are plenty of options), DO NOT BUY GOLDEN PAK PRODUCTS.<br /><br />I am beyond disappointed, and here is why:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Coconut sugar<br />REFINED SUGAR<br />POTASSIUM SORBATE-->the stuff they add to cheap brands of red wine vinegar and loads of processed foods; not the worst by far, but they couldn\\'t leave it at that :(<br />SODIUM (aka disodium) METABISULFITE-->E223 for countries that require chemical additives to be labeled (ie not the USA)--see below<br /><br />What\\'s worse is they are distributed out of Kent, WA!! Just a stone\\'s throw from Amazon HQ! Seattle\\'s supposed to be a bit better than this!<br /><br />There\\'s PLENTY of REAL palm sugar out there--I\\'ve been using the stuff--pure, plain, preservative-free, CANE SUGAR FREE palm/coconut sugar, and THIS ISN\\'T IT.<br /><br />Every benefit of palm sugar--and most things--gets totally lost when you (in ascending importance)<br /><br />1) ruin the flavor with nasty preservatives--in this case a sorbic acid salt to kill mold and a particularly nasty sulfite that kills just about EVERYTHING good and bad<br />2) do not clearly state it contains SULFITES, which happen to be DANGEROUS FOR SULFA ALLERGIC PEOPLE *hence needing to be labeled--which they only reliably do, from what I could see when I went back to get REAL palm sugar, on their 17.6oz vac-sealed single-slab packs (Na2S2O5--the disodium metabisulfite--is an inorganic, lab-made DISINFECTANT meaning ... yep, they threw it in to kill junk from poorly harvested/stored/transported stuff! ick! It\\'s what you CLEAN equipment with... not to mention it can eat through hardwood floors and top grade lumber!)... Na2S2O5 is also dangerous for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions<br />and...<br />3) Hello, when someone wants PALM/COCONUT sugar... pure straight forward stuff... don\\'t give them nasty refined sugar cane! One of palm sugar\\'s great benefits, beyond tasting awesome, is *glycemic load* and if you toss in REFINED cane (not even the less-abrasive, still-has-some-molasses Florida Crystals or succanut etc), you are just asking blood glucose to spike. Agh.<br /><br />So yeah. This stinks. I\\'m upset because this is a huge, central part to my career and I get really angry knowing that most people I work to help day in and out trust these companies to sell what they say they are selling and not hide behind \"no MSG added! (tiny print: \"except for the amount contained in yeast extract\"=>yeast itself isn\\'t a free glutamic acid containing product; it\\'s autolyzed yeast, ie break it down so much it\\'s not yeast at all anymore and has ZERO properties of yeast, merely a derivation from it like fuel from corn or sugar not being corn or sugar to your body). So yeah, Golden Pak FAILS. Golden International Corp is their head company, so there are undoubtedly things under that parent name, too. Should\\'ve known better when I saw a FISH as a logo on sugar--something fishy indeed. Negative stars.'\n"," b\"For many years I used Locatelli Romano cheese, and truly enjoyed it. I still do, however the price is, and always has been, staggering. Several months ago I began using the DeLallo Romano brand cheese. I think that it would be unfair to compare it to the Locatelli as they are two very different, though same type of cheeses. I love the Locatelli's texture and consistancy, but I love the DeLallo's flavor. For the difference in price, I will continue buying and enjoying this cheese (DeLallo). For those who may be sceptical, try it, you may find as I did that you not only have a money saver, but a terrific alternative to high priced name brand cheese.\"\n"," b\"What can I say..Amazon does it again...A huge amount of M&M's for a very small price.<br />What makes this a good deal as well is that they are all the individually wrapped M&M packages.<br />These are a great size for snacks, desserts, etc. where you don't want to sit and eat 300 of them...\"\n"," b'When ordering candy, there is always the worry of getting old & stale stuff. Well, I ordered mine from Candy Crate, and I got some excellently fresh candy corn! Well packaged, nice and fresh!<br /><br />The candy corn was inside a nice bag that will keep the freshness (which was tied on the top) and then inside of a shopping bag style bag with handles that were also tied. Then inside a box with packing paper to prevent accidental tears on the trip. Bulk packaging, but well worth it!<br /><br />This is the traditional candy corn I was looking for! Orange center, white pointy end, and yellow on the wide end. Brightly colored and tastes great! If you are looking for candy corn, this is a sweet deal!'\n"," b'I was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee. I have purchased Blue Mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great. But this was totally unsatisfactory. It had a mildewed flavor to it like it had been stored for a long time in a warehouse that was damp or moldy. For the money I paid for it I was quite displeased and will NEVER buy from them again.'\n"," b\"My favorite is Estrella espresso, but my former e-merchant chose the low road.  So be it.  Pil&oacute;n (and Bustelo) is a strong favorite, and I've used it for at least 10-12 years ... still do.  It gives me great crema, has strong but not bitter taste, and I prefer strong espresso over the fruitier styles made by other companies.  Can't go wrong with Pil&oacute;n.\"\n"," b'I have ordered several spices from hunter organic and everyone is great quality and a great price!!  I will continue to use them as I need to replenish my spice rack.'\n"," b'I see many of the reviews of this product were for PUPPIES.  Maybe they aer good for PUPPIES, but NOT FOR DOGS!!  I purchased 6 Quado dog bones. The dogs loved them and devoured them in only an hour. I was disappointed and disturbed that they went so quickly and went back to read the packaging to find a small blurb on the back of the package on the bottom right \"Quado is to be consumed over a period of time and not in once sitting or even on day.\" (1) I paid about $8 for each bone with shipping.  This was for a bone which lasted only an hour.  I expected it to be a \"bone\" not a \"treat.\"  I could have taken my dogs out to dinner for that price.  (2) If the bone is meant to be consumed over time, please make that obvious on the front of the package and not in some small print on the back.  It worries me now why they printed the statement on the back.<br /><br />I can appreciate the fact that they created environmentally-friendly products and trusted that I would be satisfied with my purchase.  I buy the best for my dogs despite not being a wealthy person.  I bought these bones because the shape is a great design.  I expected a bone that would last.  I am disappointed.  I would requested a refund for my purchase price. I have yet to hear from the company N-Bone.'\n"," b'I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged.  I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.  First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I\\'m fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don\\'t know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It\\'s probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn\\'t buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.  What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up.  I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any \"I am sorry for your inconvenience\" or any other type of apology.  I\\'m gathering these reviews are only spot checked.<br />The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy.  I\\'m just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again.  If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it\\'s just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA.  Buyer beware.'\n"," b'My daughter loves them.  I think I eat them more than she does though, especially since this was a pack of 6 boxes :)'\n"," b\"i got this because the office just got a new keurig and each of us brought in a new flavor to try. 10/11 coffee addicts hated it. it smells soooo good but tastes soooo bad. the only way me, the 11th could drink it (and that's how i finished the box) is i mixed it with hot chocolate kcup. if you're not up to mixing it, then try something else.\"\n"," b'Cutter backyard changed the formula, now it sucks. It used to be the greatest thing ever, now I need to spray weekly to give me the same results as it used to.<br />Cutter why did you change your formula?????'\n"," b\"I have been using this product for several years since I discovered it on Amazon.  I have GERD (esophageal reflux disease) and I can't drink formulations that either have too much sugar or too much acid.  This drink does not set me off like some of the other flavors do.  I has a very pleasant apple flavor, that you swear is real apple juice.  I usually mix two measuring cups (included) into a 70oz Camelback and place it into the fridge for my next day's ride.  The drink will stay cool for two hours.  This product does have sugars, although not much.  It has about 90 calories per measure, which is enough for a good ride around town.  If you are a marathoner, then you will need more calories and may need to suppliment your drink with power bars.  But this is enough for us casual riders.  If you don't want the calories, then you can decrease your measurements accordingly.  This is the only drink for me and I hope they never take it off the market.\"\n"," b\"Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.\"\n"," b\"A good basic black tea, much better than any Lipton's. Tea bags have no string or tag, so have a strainer handy. I think I still like PG Tips better tho.\"\n"," b\"I am constantly searching for the perfect tonic to complement my gin.  This one I am quite happy with.  Much less sweet than Polar, Schwepps or any other store bought brand but just what I was looking for.  Also, tried the Q Tonic which I can't say I liked at all.  This is the one I'll choose from now on.\"\n"," b'I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY SMALL DOG WHO WAS HAVEING JOINT PROBLEMS WITHIN A FEW WEEKS SHE IS NOW DOING GREAT NO MORE LIMPING GREAT PRICE AS WELL. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A JOINT SUPPLIMENT THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE.'\n"," b\"I purchased this mayonnaise thinking I was getting a product whose only added oil is organic olive oil, as its label suggests.  WRONG!!!  I agree with the other reviewers--if you are looking for a mayonnaise with truly healthy fats, don't bother with this one!  First ingredients are GMO junk: soy and/or canola oil.  Wilderness Family Naturals, on the other hand, produces a mayonnaise made exclusively with organic coconut, sesame and olive oils...\"\n"," b'As a person who is sensitive to gluten, I must use alternative flours when cooking or baking.  This flour mix is created from a formula in Bette Hagman\\'s \"Gluten Free Gourmet Bakes Bread.\"  It is an excellent mix and can be used as is, (exchange rate: 1 for 1), for any recipe which already calls for rice flour.  In her book, Bette mentions that this flour does not have the protein levels found in wheat flour and that it is advisable to add protein (usually in the form of egg whites).<br /><br />I have converted many wheat flour recipes (for yeast breads, quick breads and cookies) to use this mix just by adding 1 - 2 egg whites and a couple teaspoons xanthan gum (to replace the gluten in wheat flour).  It should be noted that adding egg whites adds moisture to the recipe, so you\\'ll need to eyeball whether or not you need to add less of another liquid or more of a dry ingredient.  Many times, I find that nothing else needs to be adjusted.<br /><br />Because I bake and cook a lot, I now mix my own Featherlight flour.<br /><br />One last thing, there is another mix made from bean flour which Bette claims exchanges 1:1 for wheat flour and can be substituted immediately into wheat recipes without the need for more protein (you\\'ll still need the xanthan gum to replace the gluten when baking).  It should be noted that some people are \"sensitive\" to the taste of bean flour to the point of ruining the enjoyment of the baked goods.  In any case, it is called Bette\\'s Four Bean Flour Blend<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007YBJIG\">Authentic Foods\\' & Bette\\'s Gourmet Four Flour Blend</a>'\n"," b'I cannot rate this item because it was never delivered to my daughter in Orlando as I ordered.  On June 25, I placed an order online and requested that I receive an e-mail confirmation.  When an e-mail was not received, I called the company and was told it was sent.  On July 2, I called because my daughter had still not received the item and was told to give it a couple of more days.  On July 6, I again called and was told that it would be resent.  Today is July 17 and nothing has been received.  When I call the company, I feel like I am bothering someone and being unreasonable to expect that I receive a product for the money that was paid.  I will never use this company again and would never recommend this company'\n"," b'Good coffee and a nice selection, but it was more expensive than you can find at Walmart or on sale at the grocery store, etc.'\n"," b\"I love Pico Pica.  It adds some flavor, and it's not too hot. I eat it at least 2 meals every day. It's good on eggs, it's good on pizza, it's good on vegetables.<br /><br />Really, you can't go wrong.\"\n"," b'I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands. After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made. My little bully\\'s stool was never firm. It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day. I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy. The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life. Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food. I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case. I started the \"at home remedy\" of pepto bismol and a bland diet. The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well. BJ fasted for 24 hours. After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!! This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!'\n"," b\"I am a GF Newbie.  There I said it. ;-)  In the beginning, I tried to buy all the flours and mix all the ingredients to get a general all purpose gluten free flour.  What a mess, what an expense!  I then started trying the GF Flour blends like Bob's Red Mill, Pamela's etc.  Eh.. didn't care for them.  I stumbled upon Better Batter and gave it a try.  This stuff was made for GF newbies!  Substitution is close to cup for cup for wheat with the addition of a little extra liquid.  I am now making breads, cakes, cookies once again and having them turn out instead of flop or turn into bricks.  Wish I had known about Better Batter when we first started on the gluten free diet.  That would have saved me time and money.\"\n"," b\"I finally found a natural, unscented deodorant with no objectionable ingredients.  I'm so happy with this product.  This stuff works.

I start to feel like lead, and lightheaded. They also mess up my tummy. Maybe it's the type of sugar they use? Evaporated cane juice is the 1st ingredient, and they also contain 2 kinds of cellulose, which I think are sugars also (but I could be wrong).<br />Anyhow, I gave 4 stars for taste, because they are THAT good, but keep in mind you may feel like you need a lengthy nap to recover from eating them.<br /><br />I agree with the previous poster they should do *something* about this ... I don't want stevia or artificial sweeteners in them, but maybe try using less sugar, or a different kind of sugar, like organic brown? I have no idea, but I would never let a kid eat more than 1 of these at a time, for fear it'd make them just pass out!<br />I eat other sweet stuff, and nothing makes me feel this bizarrely over-sugared.<br /><br />I'm not even totally sure it's the sugar that makes you feel this way ... any ideas? It's a shame, because they are so delicious. I've tried them several times, and may keep them on hand for a once-in-a-blue-moon craving, but I definitely won't be eating them often.\"\n","Label : 0\n","Keys       : ['input_type_ids', 'input_word_ids', 'input_mask']\n","Shape      : (1, 128)\n","Word Ids   : [  101  2122  2024  2200  2200  2204 18767  1012 15594  2100 16324  1010]\n","Input Mask : [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]\n","Type Ids   : [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n"]}],"source":["for text_batch, label_batch in train_ds.take(1):\n","  for i in range(1):\n","    reviews = text_batch.numpy()[i]\n","    print(f'Reviews: {text_batch.numpy()[i]}')\n","    label = label_batch.numpy()[i]\n","    print(f'Label : {label}')\n","text_test = [reviews]\n","\n","\n","text_preprocessed = bert_preprocess_model(text_test)\n","\n","print(f'Keys       : {list(text_preprocessed.keys())}')\n","print(f'Shape      : {text_preprocessed[\"input_word_ids\"].shape}')\n","print(f'Word Ids   : {text_preprocessed[\"input_word_ids\"][0, :12]}')\n","print(f'Input Mask : {text_preprocessed[\"input_mask\"][0, :12]}')\n","print(f'Type Ids   : {text_preprocessed[\"input_type_ids\"][0, :12]}')\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"gsHo6DJbukp_"},"outputs":[],"source":["bert_model = hub.KerasLayer(tfhub_handle_encoder)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1593,"status":"ok","timestamp":1657220810836,"user":{"displayName":"Yucan Wang","userId":"14255211870832587741"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"08wihq3uukp_","outputId":"9aedad83-7387-45ff-f9fa-772977923532"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Loaded BERT: https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/small_bert/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/1\n","Pooled Outputs Shape:(1, 768)\n","Pooled Outputs Values:[-0.1362212  -0.4140933   0.7284374  -0.02461981  0.4962015  -0.9999633\n","  0.38094863  0.64883775 -0.28359783  0.3192874   0.2665477   0.8321404 ]\n","Sequence Outputs Shape:(1, 128, 768)\n","Sequence Outputs Values:[[-0.23030566  1.1216165  -0.25991145 ... -0.13162059  0.13089348\n","   0.15106387]\n"," [ 0.12715214  0.12793119  0.4510724  ... -0.20547312 -0.22795019\n","   0.416003  ]\n"," [-0.5270223  -0.16219904  0.14979494 ...  0.24309061  0.03191535\n","  -0.38560492]\n"," ...\n"," [-0.49010515  0.35011417  0.49489075 ... -0.35206726  0.06831433\n","  -0.38681358]\n"," [ 0.08694478  0.28056896  0.33242583 ... -0.18619902  0.19423707\n","  -0.25848114]\n"," [-0.71181244  0.3062802  -0.22636588 ...  1.490515    0.09562337\n","  -0.85496557]]\n"]}],"source":["# use BERT to preprocessing the reviews feature victor\n","bert_results = bert_model(text_preprocessed)\n","print(f'Loaded BERT: {tfhub_handle_encoder}')\n","print(f'Pooled Outputs Shape:{bert_results[\"pooled_output\"].shape}')\n","print(f'Pooled Outputs Values:{bert_results[\"pooled_output\"][0, :12]}')\n","print(f'Sequence Outputs Shape:{bert_results[\"sequence_output\"].shape}')\n","print(f'Sequence Outputs Values:{bert_results[\"sequence_output\"][0, :12]}')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Build and train the CNN.

I start to feel like lead, and lightheaded. They also mess up my tummy. Maybe it's the type of sugar they use? Evaporated cane juice is the 1st ingredient, and they also contain 2 kinds of cellulose, which I think are sugars also (but I could be wrong).<br />Anyhow, I gave 4 stars for taste, because they are THAT good, but keep in mind you may feel like you need a lengthy nap to recover from eating them.<br /><br />I agree with the previous poster they should do *something* about this ... I don't want stevia or artificial sweeteners in them, but maybe try using less sugar, or a different kind of sugar, like organic brown? I have no idea, but I would never let a kid eat more than 1 of these at a time, for fear it'd make them just pass out!<br />I eat other sweet stuff, and nothing makes me feel this bizarrely over-sugared.<br /><br />I'm not even totally sure it's the sugar that makes you feel this way ... any ideas? It's a shame, because they are so delicious. I've tried them several times, and may keep them on hand for a once-in-a-blue-moon craving, but I definitely won't be eating them often.\"]"]},"execution_count":63,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["text_test"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"CuyM4XEXukqB","outputId":"f5049597-57c0-4fa4-e339-dda17e7e4cb4"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Model:
